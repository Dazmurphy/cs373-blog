**1.What did you do this past week?**

This past week I was very happy with my vast improvement in my quiz results.
I also received a very good score in my Netflix project. With the week ending
on a high of these results I am starting to feel like I'm getting to grips
with the course. We had a guest speaker this week from Mutual Mobile. The
speaker was a previous CS graduate from UT. I'm enjoying the trend of previous
graduates coming back to speak to us because it shows that the CS program here
fosters a certain pride in their students. He gave an interesting talk about open
source projects and the company he works for also.


**2.What's in your way?**

Right now I've just got to knuckle down and study, study, study. I've no
idea what to expect from this quiz but the fact that we can bring a sheet of notes
seems pretty generous. At the same time this makes me wary as it could imply
that we will actually need every inch of that paper to help us through.

**3.What will you do next week?**

Next week we will do the first exam of the term for software engineering.

**Tip of the week**

My tip of the week is to ensure you don't get bogged down into one particular
assignment for one of your courses, and neglect the others. I find this can
happen a lot, especially when doing coding assignments. Try to spread your time
evenly and jump between projects regularly.
