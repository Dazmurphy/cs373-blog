**1.What did you do this past week?**

This week we finished up with python and moved onto relational algebra. I've
taken a databases class back in Ireland so a lot of the stuff we were covering
I had working knowledge of already. We also finished project 3 this week which
proved stressful enough although I think we did a good job. Obviously some
things didn't go as expected but we got it submitted so that was a relief.
There's still some work I need to do before we move onto the next phase.


**2.What's in your way?**

For now I just need to tidy up the parts of phase one that I didn't complete
as well as I would have liked. Once we get the phase two specs I expect we'll
all get stuck into it immediately. I need to pick up my other classes again
because I neglected them quite a bit this past week.


**3.What will you do next week?**

Next week I expect we will start phase two of the web project. I'd say we will
also cover a lot more relational algebra in more detail.

**Tip of the week**

While working on the design for our website I wanted to download several web
safe fonts to preview in photoshop. I found <a href="https://skyfonts.com/">Skyfonts</a>.
It allowed me to install multiple fonts with one click on several font websites,
most importantly Google Web Fonts. Just a small tool that sped up my workflow,
which is always something worth checking out.
