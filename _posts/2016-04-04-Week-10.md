**1.What did you do this past week?**

This past week we continued to work on the second phase of the web project, we
also received our grades back for the first phase of the assignment. I was
pleasantly surprised with how this went considering some of our website
wasn't properly connected. We also received a very interesting talk from two
employees of Atlassian. They covered a lot of content within the lecture and it
was very informative. We briefly covered some regular expressions and json.


**2.What's in your way?**

Right now we just have to finish the second phase of this web project. This is
going better than the first phase as we have a better idea of what everyone's
strengths are, and how our timetables fit together.


**3.What will you do next week?**

Next week we will finish the second phase of the project (hopefully). We will
likely cover some more SQL in-depth.

**Tip of the week**

This isn't so much a tip as an interesting, albeit short, article giving advice
on what skills programmers should work on improving. It's sort of in-line with why
we were encouraged to write these blogs. Anyways here's the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ex-microsoft-engineer-advice-success-2015-10?utm_source=feedly">article</a>.
