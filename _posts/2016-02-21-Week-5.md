**1.What did you do this past week?**

This week myself and my coding partner completed our Netflix program with a
RMSE of 0.96. We were quite pleased with this as we started to assignment
quite late with only 4 days until the deadline. We got it all working
but then we added an assertion which we didn't test and submitted the assignment
with an assertion error. We were slightly annoyed that we neglected testing
this but it's only 20% in the grand scheme and we are pretty confident with
the rest of our program.

**2.What's in your way?**

As of right now we have the date of our midterm which is Thursday week.


**3.What will you do next week?**
