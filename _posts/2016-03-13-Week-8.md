**1.What did you do this past week?**

This last week we learned about what our third project would consist of. We formed
our groups and decided on a theme for our project. We also got our exam results
back for our mid term. A guest speaker from Rackspace explained to us how
to setup an account on their site and spin up their containers. We didn't have
any class on Friday so we got to start Spring Break early.


**2.What's in your way?**

Right now the main thing is getting to grips with all the requirements for
project 3. Our team has started it and made some progress. We have assigned
roles to each other and are working on our individual pieces during Spring Break.
I expect we'll meet during the week to bring it all together.

**3.What will you do next week?**

Spring break. Get to relax a bit and enjoy the time off, before re-commencing
the semester on Monday.

**Tip of the week**

Make sure and get stuck into the next project as early as possible, I think it's
clear from how much the professor explained how much work there is. Hopefully it
all comes together as smooth as possible but that's difficult to be sure of when
working with people you havn't before.
